# finalProj_yieldCurvePredict
Final Project for Principles of Data Science

There is a well-known algorithm that the U.S. Treasury uses to generate the yield curve every day.
In this project I use financial data from the stock market, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the 
U.S. Federal Reserve to predict the yield curve using an XGBoost model.
